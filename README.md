This is a hobby project of Edit Selmeczi, created for her personal portfolio.

The project contains the frontend of a made up webshop of a made up flower company.

Tech stack used:

       - React, using react hooks: useState, useEffect, useContext. Although there is no backend to handle user action, adding and removing items to the shopping cart is working. This feature is created with useContext and context provider.

       - react-router-dom: Router is used for navigation between the pages.
       
       - styled components: responsive hamburger menu created with styled-components.
       
       - CSS: Style created with CSS, aims to get a minimalist user friendly responsive design.
